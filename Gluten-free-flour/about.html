            <h2>Benefits of Gluten Free Flour?</h2>
            <p>Do you feel uneasy after having chapati or bread? Well, that might be due to your gluten intolerance! 

                Nowadays, many people are complaining about grogginess, stomach upset, swelling on the skin and itchy rashes after having regular Atta products. If you are facing these types of problems, you should give gluten-free atta a shot!                
                Wondering what's gluten? What gluten free atta benefits are? Why does gluten cause allergies? Is gluten free atta only for those who suffer from gluten intolerance ? Don't worry! We have all the answers. 
                To answer simply, gluten free flour contains alternatives to using wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It may contain one flour, or a blend of different types of flour from sources such as rice, corn, arrowroot, quinoa, beans, lentils, almonds, potatoes, tapioca, and other safe to consume foods.
                While many people think gluten-free diets are more nutritious and contain more minerals and vitamins than conventional foods, the opposite is often true. Gluten-free foods are commonly less fortified with folic acid, iron, and other nutrients than regular foods containing gluten.
